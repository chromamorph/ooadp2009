/**
 * Q5. Write a program that asks the user for two Strings and prints out the one
 * that comes earlier in the dictionary. (Hint: Use the String compareTo method
 * to find out which of two Strings comes first alphabetically. For example, if
 * a.compareTo(b) == -1 then a comes before b.)
 * 
 * Actually, a.compareTo(b) < 0 => a is less than b in UTF-8.
