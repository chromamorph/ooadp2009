	/*
	 * Every class in Java is a subclass of the Object class. The Object class
	 * has a method whose signature is
	 * 
	 * public String toString()
	 * 
	 * This method returns a String that represents the object on which it is
	 * called. For example, if t is an object, then
	 * 
	 * t.toString();
	 * 
	 * should return an appropriate String description of the object t.
	 * 
	 * Every class you create therefore inherits a toString method from its
	 * superclass (which might be the Object class if the class does not have an
	 * explicit superclass). This inherited method should be overridden in every
	 * class you create so that it generates a String that appropriately
	 * represents objects of the class.
	 * 
	 * The definition of the toString method should return an appropriate
	 * description of an instance of the class.
	 * 
	 * This toString method overrides the one defined in the Object class.
	 * 
	 * Whenever you print out the value of an object using System.out.println,
	 * the toString() method is automatically called. For example, if t is an
	 * Object, then
	 * 
	 * System.out.println(t);
	 * 
	 * will actually print out the value of t.toString().
