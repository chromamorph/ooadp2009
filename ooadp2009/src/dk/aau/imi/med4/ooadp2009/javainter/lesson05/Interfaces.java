/**
 * Illustrates the use of interfaces.
 * 
 * An interface is like a class in which all the methods are abstract.
 * 
 * An interface contains no implemented methods - it is pure design. An abstract
 * class is a mixture of design and implementation and a concrete class is pure
 * implementation.
 * 
 * An interface contains a collection of method declarations that form a
 * contract for a type.
 * 
 * A class can only extend a single superclass but it can implement more than
 * one interface. This means that a class can fulfill many different roles, each
 * defined by a different interface.
 * 
 * "Every major class in an application should be an implementation of some
 * interface that captures the contract of that class." (Arnold et al, 2006, p.
 * 117)
 * 
 * Liskov substitutability principle applies to implemented interfaces as well
 * as superclasses: a reference to any interface implemented by a class, C, can
 * refer to an object of class, C.
 * 
 * Interfaces can be variable types just as classes can.
 * 
 * An interface can extend more than one superinterface.
 * 
 * An interface can define constants, that is, public, static, final fields. The
 * modifiers are always omitted by convention.
 * 
 * All methods in an interface must be public and abstract. The modifiers are
 * omitted by convention.
