/**
 * This package illustrates the use of abstract classes.
 * 
 * An abstract method is one that is not implemented.
 * 
 * An abstract class is one that contains at least one abstract method.
 * 
 * An abstract class cannot be instantiated because not all of its methods are
 * implemented.
 * 
 * In this example, we have an abstract class, Shape, and two concrete 
 * subclasses of shape, Circle and Rectangle.
 * 
 * We instantiate some Circles and Rectangles and put them in an array
 * of Shapes, then iterate over this array, applying various methods
 * to each Shape object in the array (whose runtime type will be
 * either Circle or Rectangle).

		 * are Shapes (i.e., they are specializations of Shape).
		 * 
		 */

		/*
		 * We can now iterate over the shapes array using the enhanced for loop.
		 * 
		 * Note that the variable s is a polymorphic variable of type Shape, so
		 * it can only access the properties and methods of an object that it shares
		 * with Shape.
		 * 
		 * All Shape objects have getHeight, getWidth, getArea, getTopLeft, getBottomRight
		 * and translate methods, though the way they are implemented depends on their
		 * runtime type (i.e., whether they are Circles or Rectangles).
		 * 
		 * The method calls in the inner for loop below therefore illustrate dynamic binding.
