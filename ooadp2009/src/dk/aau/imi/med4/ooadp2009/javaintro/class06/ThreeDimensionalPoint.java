	 * subclass, we therefore have to explicitly define it. The first thing a
	 * no-args constructor does is call the no-args constructor of its
	 * superclass. However this is not explicitly written in the constructor. In
	 * this case, the no-args constructor will first set the x and y fields to 0
	 * using the Point() constructor and then call the line setZ(0).
	 * 
	 * In other words, there is an invisible call to the superclass's no-args
	 * constructor (in this case Point()) that comes before the first written
	 * line of this class's no-args constructor.

	 * and y fields from its superclass, Point. These fields have to be set to
	 * the values given in the x and y arguments of this constructor.
	 * 
	 * It is usually best to do this by calling an appropriate constructor
	 * defined on the superclass as the first line in the constructor. This is
	 * done by using the "super" construct. In this case,
	 * 
	 * super(x, y)
	 * 
	 * calls the constructor of Point that takes two double arguments (since x
	 * and y are both doubles) (i.e., it calls Point(double x, double y)).
